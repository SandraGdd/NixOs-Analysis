## Market Analysis: Nix Commercial Adoption

Nix is an open-source package manager that employs a functional, declarative approach to software management. Nix provides precise control over software versions and dependencies, ensuring that configurations are reproducible and isolated from one another. This approach makes NixOS especially popular with developers and companies who prioritize stability, consistency, and easy rollbacks in complex or production environments.

## Project Brief
Goal: Assessing trends in the commercial adoption of Nix over the past 12 months.

Numtide.com, a software development agency, is considering an expansion of its service offerings around Nix, an open-source programming language. This analysis aims to provide insights into the evolving market landscape of Nix, informing Numtide's decision-making process.

## Objectives
1. Identify measurable trends in commercial adoption of Nix
2. Contextualize growth trends between commercial, private and institutional entities 
3. Analyze the types, sizes and geographical distribution of adopting companies


## Methodology
The key performance indicator (KPI) for this market analysis will be the number of commits made by companies to the NixOS repository (https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs). Numtide requested insights into "adoption", which is not a rigidly defined term, together we have established that a company contributing commits to the repository demonstrates a long-term interest in the technology, thus qualifying as an adopter.

This approach allows us to:
Quantify commercial engagement with Nix, Track adoption trends over time, Identify key players in the Nix ecosystem

By analyzing these commits, we aim to provide Numtide with valuable insights to guide their strategic expansion into Nix-related services.
